*Improve your skills by training with others on real code challenges*

**Videos**
- [All the Little Things - Sandi Metz](https://youtu.be/8bZh5LMaSmE)
*Theory tells us to build applications out of small, interchangeable objects but reality often supplies the exact opposite. Many apps contain huge classes of long methods and hair-raising conditionals; they're hard to understand, difficult to reuse and costly to change. This talk takes an ugly section of conditional code and converts it into a few simple objects. It bridges the gap between OO theory and practice and teaches straightforward strategies that all can use to improve their code.*

**Articles/Posts**
- [Is Ruby pass by reference or pass by value?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1872110/is-ruby-pass-by-reference-or-by-value/10974116#10974116)
*StackOverflow answer*

**Books**
- [Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby](http://it-ebooks.info/book/4606/)
*Ruby's widely admired ease of use has a downside: Too many Ruby and Rails applications have been created without concern for their long-term maintenance or evolution. The Web is awash in Ruby code that is now virtually impossible to change or extend. This text helps you solve that problem by using powerful real-world object-oriented design techniques, which it thoroughly explains using simple and practical Ruby examples.*


## Rails

**Websites**
- [RailsGuides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/)
*These guides are designed to make you immediately productive with Rails, and to help you understand how all of the pieces fit together.*

**Books**
- [Agile Web Development with Rails, 4th Edition](http://it-ebooks.info/book/4/)
*Rails just keeps on changing. Rails 3 and Ruby 1.9 bring hundreds of improvements, including new APIs and substantial performance enhancements. The fourth edition of this award-winning classic has been reorganized and refocused so it's more useful than ever before for developers new to Ruby and Rails.*
